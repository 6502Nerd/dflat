# dflat
dflat is a BASIC-like language for 8-bit micros and retro computers running on 6502 and 65c02.

The base version here is targeted for the Oric-1 and Atmos computers from the early 80s and due to being integer only and tokenisation, is much faster than Oric BASIC.

Right now I am in documentation mode - please see the wiki pages for details of the language.

The source and binaries are in the Oric-DFLAT folder.  Read the readme for quickstart guide if you want try the dflat language rather than build it from scratch.

I also have a hackaday page for this where I have already put up binaries and example programs for download
