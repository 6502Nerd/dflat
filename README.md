# dflat
dflat is a BASIC-like language for 8-bit micros and retro computers running on 6502 and 65c02

The base version here is targeted for the Oric-1 and Atmos computers from the early 80s.

Right now I am in documentation mode before I upload the source which will require;
- The as65 assembler (freely distributable so I will add here)
- Running a windows command shell for the build script (which was needed for multi-bank ROM build, but is just 1 bank here)

I also have a hackaday page for this where I have already put up binaries and example programs for download
